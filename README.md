# Mathematical Statements and Truth Table Generator

This Python program allows users to evaluate logical operations on given inputs and generates truth tables. 
It provides a terminal interface to interact with the program and evaluates input by conjunction, disjunction, negation, implication, and biconditional statements.

## Operations

- Performs logical operations (AND, OR, NOT, IF...THEN, IF AND ONLY IF).
- Displays results of operations based on user inputs.
- Generates a truth table showing all possible values of A and B and results of logical operations.

## Run the Program

1. **Install Python**: Ensure Python is installed. Download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Save Program**: Copy program code into a file with a `.py` extension. For example, `math-statements.py`.

3. **Terminal/Command Prompt**: Open terminal or command prompt.

4. **Navigate to Directory**: Navigate to directory containing `math-statements.py`:
   ```
   cd path/to/your/directory
   ```
5. **Run the Program**: Run program with command:
   ```
   python3 math-statements.py
   ```
